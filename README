The purpose of this project is to go through java code and spell out the
puncutations and separate variable names such that we can use them to create 
a language model.

ProcessFile.java ===

The main method of interest is process(). Given an input file name and
a corresponding output file name we spell out all puncutation and split
agglutinations (variable names that are in camel case and/or snake case)


Main.java ===

In this class, we use a java lexer to go through each token and do the
appropriate action with each token
